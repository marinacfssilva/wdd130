    <p>Hi! My name is Marina Cuellar Fernandes Sanches da Silva. I was born in Brazil, Sao Paulo and now I have lived in the United States for almost 5 years, in Salt Lake City - Utah. I've been married for 17 years and I still don't have human children, I just has a cat. We moved from Brazil to the United States study and learn more about American culture. I decided I needed improve my English, then I discovered Pathway Connect course. With him I was able to learn the language more and I decided to go to college here, starting over in a new place path. I am a biologist and work in the field for more than 10 years in Brazil, but I no longer feel fulfilled doing this. I decided to do Fundamentals of Graphic Design and Web and Computer Programming because I always wanted to this area, but I didn't have the courage to start in another area that I've always really liked.It's been a big challenge to study this area that's so new to me, but it's been a pleasant path to discovering something that I really identify with.</p>

    <p> Sao Paulo is the most populous city in Brazil and one of the largest in the world, with more than 12 million inhabitants. It is located in the State that bears the same name, which is located in the Southeast region of the country. The city of Sao Paulo is the country's main economic and financial center. Due to its intense economic activity and large population, the city is characterized by numerous residential and commercial buildings, which dominate the local landscape. The city is located within the Atlantic Forest biome, but much of the native vegetation was deforested in the urbanization process. The Tiete and Pinheiros rivers are the two main watercourses that flow through the city, however both had their course intensely modified to meet the demands of the urbanization process and currently both are highly polluted. Sao Paulo is considered a major cultural center in Brazil, due to the wide variety of museums, concerts, festivals and music shows and gastronomic variety.</p>
